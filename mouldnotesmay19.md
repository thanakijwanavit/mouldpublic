1. Modify the hole size from a diameter of 11.5mm to 11.2mm 
2. increase venting at the top weldline
3. fix flashing between inserts

Description : top cover
1. change thickness from 2mm to 2.5 mm
2. thickness at the screw installation points highlighted will need to follow the drawing
3. increase the thickness around the part to fit into other assembly parts
### Taiyu comment reply: 
1. we dont need to modify the part because we modify another part instead
2. reduce thickness from 1.8mm to 1.6mm --> confirmed
3. reduce thickness from 1.8mm to 1.6mm --> confirmed
4. change the parting line --> confirmed

Description wire cover lid
1. remove ribs (2 positions) around the closing mechanism
2. the ribs dimensions behind the part is actually ok
3. add 10% to gate thickness

Description : support top cover
1. change ribs thickness to 1.6 mm

### Taiyu comment reply:
1. add venting and ribs change to 1.6mm
2. adding cooling channels for the hotspot --> confirmed

1.remove both drainage channel inserts and modify into 1 single circular drainage channel. The cooling channel should be a bubbler and should be as large as possible (at least 10 mm)

### Taiyu comment reply:
1. Add more venting  --> confirmed
2. cooling channel in original design: --> This is too risky from the mechanical strength perspective. Also it is likely that the channel is too small and will make the flow lamina which is bad for the heat removal.

1. Waiting for quotation on 2 alternative hotrunner
> 1. Single sprue with an extension into the mould part --> Need to be careful about the leakage
> 2. two Valve gates hot runner

### Taiyu comment reply:
1. add overflow to deal with weldlines --> confirmed

### Taiyu comment reply:
1. change the thickness of the runner as per the drawing --> confirmed

1. Change metrial to PP-Talc (still need testing).
> The shrinkage of PP-Talc is between 0.9-1.4 vs ABS shrinkage of 0.7-1.6 
> This means that it should be compatible with ABS moulds (need to try first)

### Taiyu comment reply:
1. Add venting --> confirmed

### Taiyu comment reply:
1. This point is not very important and we can accept the mould as is

1. we would like to get a confirmed CMM result for the mould in the area which the runner is concerned. 
> We will send you the latest confirmed drawing of the runner. Please make the dimension exactly according to the drawing
> The mould will be optimized in Hatari by the production team.
